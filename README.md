## Summary
SAS Visual Data Mining and Machine Learning (SAS VDMML) provides a comprehensive, collaborative visual interface for accomplishing all steps related to the analytical life cycle on a massively parallel processing infrastructure. The **machine learning pipelines in Model Studio** (that is part of SAS VDMML) lets you explore and compare multiple modeling approaches rapidly. You can quickly and easily find the optimal parameter settings for diverse machine learning algorithms – including decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks, support vector machines and factorization machines – simply by selecting the option you want. Complex local search optimization routines work hard in the background to efficiently and effectively tune your models.
