This example SAS code shows how to preprocess inut data in terms not columns
(as in ```update_metdata``` example) but rows. It simply doubles the input 
dataset in terms of rows. Of course the example is very easy but the data step
included can (and should) be modified to create more complex transformations.

**Instructions:** In Model Studio, add a SAS Code node to your pipeline, 
then open it and paste snippets of this code as needed into the Training Code 
pane, then save and close the node.
