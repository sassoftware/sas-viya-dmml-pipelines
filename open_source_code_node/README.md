## Summary

The **open_source_code_node** folder contains example pipelines and materials for using Model Studio's Open Source Code node that is first shipped as part of SAS Visual Data Mining and Machine Learning (VDMML) 8.3 release.

In Model Studio, the Open Source Code node is a Miscellaneous node that can run Python or R code. This node can subsequently be moved to the Supervised Learning group if a Python or R model needs to be assessed and compared with other models using the Model Comparison node. For convenience, a [list of variables](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=vdmmlcdc&cdcVersion=8.3&docsetId=vdmmlref&docsetTarget=p0doq3u7i2yghzn1azsbn1eu9zmf.htm&locale=en) are made available to the user in the Open Source Code node editor.
